 <br>[Chorus]
 
               C                  Em
Decisions as I go, to anywhere I flow.
               Am                  F
Sometimes I believe, at times I'm rational.
             C           Em
I can fly high, i can go low
               Am                         F
Today I got a million, tomorrow, I don't know.
               C                  Em
Decisions as I go, to anywhere I flow.
               Am                 F
Sometimes I believe, at times I'm rational.
             C           Em
I can fly high, i can go low
               Am                         F
Today I got a million, tomorrow, I don't know.

[Verse 1]
 
                       C                        Em
Stop claiming what you own and think about the show.
                       Am                     F
We're all playing the same game, laying down alone.
                  C                     Em
We're unknown and known, special and a clone.
                    Am                           F
Hate will make you cautious, love will make you glow.
                  C                     Em
Make me feel the warm, make me feel the cold.
                     Am                         F
It's written in our story, it's written on the walls.
             C                    Em
This is our call, we rise and we fall.
                Am                          F
Dancin' in the moonlight, don't we have it all?
 
 
[Instrumental]
 
C  Em  Am  F  (x3)
 
 
[Chorus]
 
               C                  Em
Decisions as I go, to anywhere I flow.
               Am                    F
Sometimes I believe, at times I'm rational.
             C           Em
I can fly high, i can go low
               Am                         F
Today I got a million, tomorrow, I don't know.
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
                  C                     Em
Make me feel the warm, make me feel the cold.
                     Am                         F
It's written in our story, it's written on the walls.
             C                    Em
This is our call, we rise and we fall.
                Am                          F
Dancin' in the moonlight, don't we have it all?

 <br>[Chorus]
                        F                           C
Well, you only need the light when it's burning low
              G                       Am
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
               F                           C       G
Only know you love her when you let her go
                      F                            C
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
              G                          Am
Only hate the road when you're missin' home
               F                           C
Only know you love her when you let her go
G
  And you let her go
 
[Instrumental]
Am   F   G   Em
Am   F   G
 
[Verse 1]
Am                            F
Staring at the bottom of your glass
        G                          Em
Hoping one day you'll make a dream last
                  Am              F          G
But dreams come slow and they go so fast
    Am                          F
You see her when you close your eyes
      G                         Em
Maybe one day you'll understand why
               Am            F        G
Everything you touch surely dies
 
[Chorus]
                      F                           C
But you only need the light when it's burning low
              G                       Am
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
               F                           C       G
Only know you love her when you let her go
                      F                            C
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
              G                          Am
Only hate the road when you're missin' home
               F                           C       G
Only know you love her when you let her go
 
[Verse 2]
Am                            F
Staring at the ceiling in the dark
         G                     Em
Same old empty feeling in your heart
                    Am              F       G
'Cause love comes slow and it goes so fast
         Am                      F
Well you see her when you fall asleep
             G                  Em
But never to touch and never to keep
                         Am
'Cause you loved her too much
                F        G
And you dived too deep
 
[Chorus]
                        F                           C
Well, you only need the light when it's burning low
              G                       Am
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
               F                           C       G
Only know you love her when you let her go
                      F                           C
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
              G                          Am
Only hate the road when you're missin' home
               F                         C       G
Only know you love her when you let her go
 
[Bridge]
                Am
And you let her go
      F     G
Ooooo ooooo oooooo
                Am
And you let her go
        F     G
Ooooooo ooooo ooooo
                Am         F    G   Em
And you let her go
 
[Interlude]
Am    F    G
 
[Chorus]
                         F                           C
'Cause you only need the light when it's burning low
              G                       Am
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
               F                          C       G
Only know you love her when you let her go
                      F                            C
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
              G                          Am
Only hate the road when you're missin' home
               F                          C       G
Only know you love her when you let her go
 
[Chorus]
(One Strum)
                         F                           C
'Cause you only need the light when it's burning low
              G                       Am
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
               F                           C       G
Only know you love her when you let her go
N.C.
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
 
Only hate the road when you're missin' home
 
Only know you love her when you let her go
 
And you let her go
