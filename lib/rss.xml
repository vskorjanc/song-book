 <br>[Verse 1]
 
F                   Am
She may contain the urge to run away
             Dm
But hold her down with soggy clothes and breezeblocks
F                   Am
Citrezene your fever’s gripped me again
       Dm
Never kisses all you ever send are fullstops - la la la la

Do you know where the wilds things go
Dm
They go along to take your honey - la la la la
F                            Am
Break down now weep build up breakfast now

 <br>[Verse 1]
 
G        D/F#     Em
 Give me time, to realise my crime;
G       D/F#      Em
 Let me love, and steal.
G       D/F#   Em
 I have danced inside your eyes;
G        D/F# Em
 How can I be real?
 
 
[Chorus 1]
 
G       D/F#           Em
 Do you really want to hurt me?
G       D/F#           Em
 Do you really want to make me cry?
C         G                  Am
 Precious kisses, words that burn me;
Bm                    Bm     [ Bm/E ]
 Lovers never ask you why.
 
G      D/F#               Em
 In my heart, the fire is burning,
G          D/F#           Em
 Choose my colour, find a star.
C         G             Am
 Precious people always tell me;
Bm/D                       Bm
 That's a step, a step too far.

G          D/F#        Em
 Words are few, I have spoken,
G        D/F#             Em
 I could waste a thousand years.
C           G                 Am
 Wrapped in sorrow, words are token,
Bm                        Bm        [ Bm/E ]
 Come inside and catch my tears.
 
G            D/F#            Em
 You've been talking, but be-lieve me,
G        D/F#            Em
 If it's true, you don't know.
C         G               Am
 This boy loves without a reason,
Bm                       Bm     [ Bm/E ]
 I'm prepared to let you go.
 
 
[Bridge 1]
 
C                 D                  C         D
 If it's love you want from me, then take it a-way.
C                 D                  C      D
 Everything's not what you see; it's over a-gain.

                        F                           C
Well, you only need the light when it's burning low

Only miss the sun when it starts to snow

Hoping one day you'll make a dream last

You see her when you close your eyes

Maybe one day you'll understand why

Everything you touch surely dies

Only know you love her when you let her go
                      F                            C
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
              G                          Am
Only hate the road when you're missin' home
               F                           C       G
Only know you love her when you let her go
 
[Verse 2]
Am                            F
Staring at the ceiling in the dark
         G                     Em
Same old empty feeling in your heart
                    Am              F       G
'Cause love comes slow and it goes so fast
         Am                      F
Well you see her when you fall asleep
             G                  Em
But never to touch and never to keep
                         Am
'Cause you loved her too much
                F        G
And you dived too deep
 
[Chorus]
                        F                           C
Well, you only need the light when it's burning low
              G                       Am
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
               F                           C       G
Only know you love her when you let her go
                      F                           C
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
              G                          Am
Only hate the road when you're missin' home
               F                         C       G
Only know you love her when you let her go
 
[Bridge]
                Am
And you let her go
      F     G
Ooooo ooooo oooooo
                Am
And you let her go
        F     G
Ooooooo ooooo ooooo
                Am         F    G   Em
And you let her go
 
[Interlude]
Am    F    G
 
[Chorus]
                         F                           C
'Cause you only need the light when it's burning low
              G                       Am
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
               F                          C       G
Only know you love her when you let her go
                      F                            C
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
              G                          Am
Only hate the road when you're missin' home
               F                          C       G
Only know you love her when you let her go
 
[Chorus]
(One Strum)
                         F                           C
'Cause you only need the light when it's burning low
              G                       Am
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
               F                           C       G
Only know you love her when you let her go
N.C.
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
 
Only hate the road when you're missin' home
 
Only know you love her when you let her go
 
And you let her go

 <br>[Chorus]
 
               C                  Em
Decisions as I go, to anywhere I flow.
               Am                  F
Sometimes I believe, at times I'm rational.
             C           Em
I can fly high, i can go low
               Am                         F
Today I got a million, tomorrow, I don't know.
               C                  Em
Decisions as I go, to anywhere I flow.
               Am                 F
Sometimes I believe, at times I'm rational.
             C           Em
I can fly high, i can go low
               Am                         F
Today I got a million, tomorrow, I don't know.

[Verse 1]
 
                       C                        Em
Stop claiming what you own and think about the show.
                       Am                     F
We're all playing the same game, laying down alone.
                  C                     Em
We're unknown and known, special and a clone.
                    Am                           F
Hate will make you cautious, love will make you glow.
                  C                     Em
Make me feel the warm, make me feel the cold.
                     Am                         F
It's written in our story, it's written on the walls.
             C                    Em
This is our call, we rise and we fall.
                Am                          F
Dancin' in the moonlight, don't we have it all?

C  Em  Am  F  (x3)
 
 
[Chorus]
 
               C                  Em
Decisions as I go, to anywhere I flow.

Sometimes I believe, at times I'm rational.
             C           Em
I can fly high, i can go low
               Am                         F
Today I got a million, tomorrow, I don't know.
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
                  C                     Em
Make me feel the warm, make me feel the cold.
                     Am                         F
It's written in our story, it's written on the walls.
             C                    Em
This is our call, we rise and we fall.

I was scared of pretty girls and starting conversations
    Am         G               C
Oh, all my friends are turning green
           Am          G                 C
You're the magician's assistant in their dreams

I love you when you're singing that song, and I got a lump

In my throat, 'cause you're gonna sing the words wrong
 
[Verse 2]
Am                 G                   C
There's this movie that I think you'll like

This guy decides to quit his job and heads to New York City
     Am       G            C
This cowboy's running from himself
    Am                G                C
And she's been living on the highest shelf
