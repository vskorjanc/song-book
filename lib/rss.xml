                        F                           CWell, you only need the light when it's burning low
              G                       AmOnly miss the sun when it starts to snow
               F                           C       GOnly know you love her when you let her go
                      F                            COnly know you've been high when you're feeling low
              G                          AmOnly hate the road when you're missin' home
               F                           COnly know you love her when you let her go
G  And you let her go
 
[Instrumental]
Am   F   G   EmAm   F   G 
[Verse 1]
Am                            FStaring at the bottom of your glass
        G                          EmHoping one day you'll make a dream last
                  Am              F          GBut dreams come slow and they go so fast
    Am                          FYou see her when you close your eyes
      G                         EmMaybe one day you'll understand why
               Am            F        GEverything you touch surely dies
 
[Chorus]
                      F                           CBut you only need the light when it's burning low
              G                       AmOnly miss the sun when it starts to snow
               F                           C       GOnly know you love her when you let her go
                      F                            COnly know you've been high when you're feeling low
              G                          AmOnly hate the road when you're missin' home
               F                           C       GOnly know you love her when you let her go
 
[Verse 2]
Am                            FStaring at the ceiling in the dark
         G                     EmSame old empty feeling in your heart
                    Am              F       G'Cause love comes slow and it goes so fast
         Am                      FWell you see her when you fall asleep
             G                  EmBut never to touch and never to keep
                         Am'Cause you loved her too much
                F        GAnd you dived too deep
 
[Chorus]
                        F                           CWell, you only need the light when it's burning low
              G                       AmOnly miss the sun when it starts to snow
               F                           C       GOnly know you love her when you let her go
                      F                           COnly know you've been high when you're feeling low
              G                          AmOnly hate the road when you're missin' home
               F                         C       GOnly know you love her when you let her go
 
[Bridge]
                AmAnd you let her go
      F     GOoooo ooooo oooooo
                AmAnd you let her go
        F     GOoooooo ooooo ooooo
                Am         F    G   EmAnd you let her go
 
[Interlude]
Am    F    G 
[Chorus]
                         F                           C'Cause you only need the light when it's burning low
              G                       AmOnly miss the sun when it starts to snow
               F                          C       GOnly know you love her when you let her go
                      F                            COnly know you've been high when you're feeling low
              G                          AmOnly hate the road when you're missin' home
               F                          C       GOnly know you love her when you let her go
 
[Chorus]
(One Strum)
                         F                           C'Cause you only need the light when it's burning low
              G                       AmOnly miss the sun when it starts to snow
               F                           C       GOnly know you love her when you let her go
N.C.
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
 
Only hate the road when you're missin' home
 
Only know you love her when you let her go
 
And you let her go
